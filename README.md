# Wildbee_diversity_CH

## Description

This repository contains the scripts for the figures in the paper "Wild bee taxonomic and functional metrics reveal a spatial mismatch between α- and ß-diversity in Switzerland" in Conservation Biology.

## Data

The data can be found in the repository [envidat](www.envidat.ch) under the following doi: <https://www.doi.org/10.16904/envidat.337>

The data includes the following:

-   The calculated community-level metrics (the responses) used in the paper:

    -   Alpha taxonomic community metrics: species richness and Shannon diversity

    -   Alpha functional community metrics: Functional richness (using the
        Trait Onion Peeling index, TOP), functional eveness (using the Trait
        Even Distribution index, TED) and the functional dispersion.

    -   Community weighted means of 8 functional traits

    -   The local community contributions on the functional and taxonomic beta diversity (LCBD).

-   The environmental predictors used for the modelling

-   The model evaluation, variable importance and partial dependece data.
